# Minecraft Earth Discord Server Archive
This is a work-in-progress project to archive the entirety of the Minecraft Earth Discord server.

Right now, the archive is very unoptimized as there are repeated assets for each channel and all content loads at once in a single HTML page. While that will be sufficient for archive purposes, the end goal is to create a viewer that renders content from JSON files in a similar fashion to Discord.
