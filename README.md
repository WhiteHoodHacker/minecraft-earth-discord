# Minecraft Earth Discord Server Archive
This is a work-in-progress project to archive the entirety of the Minecraft Earth Discord server.

Right now, the archive is very unoptimized as there are repeated assets for each channel and all content in a channel loads at once on a single HTML page. While that will be sufficient for archive purposes, the end goal is to create a viewer that renders content from JSON files in a similar fashion to Discord. As a result, you'll find both HTML and JSON copies of channels.

Timestamps are in Pacific Time, which switches from PST (UTC-8:00) and PDT (UTC-7:00). Otherwise, UNIX timestamps are used.
