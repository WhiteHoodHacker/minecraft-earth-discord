Do you lose your whole inventory?\nA: We are currently refining the Adventure system, but there is no reward without a little risk. You will need to craft and prepare to fight in Adventures, but if you die you might lose something ;)\n\n- Are you able to give any details on the size of the larger build plates coming in the future?\nA: Currently you can unlock and build on 8x8 block plates and 16x16 block plates. We are looking at larger sizes as we want you to build huge amazing things.\n\n- 1) Will Minecraft Earth have some in game system to help players group up for Adventures?  Or will players have to seek out third party apps to coordinate meet-ups and adventures (like in Pokemon Go and Harry Potter WU)?\nA: We loving playing together in MCE, it is so amazing to fight in Adventures with friends and so this is very important to us. Initially you will be able to meet up and play with other people, its super easy to jump into Adventures together. We are looking into new systems to enhance this in the future.\n\n2) Public builds seem like they will be a very popular feature. However, there might not be enough real-estate or spots for these public builds to meet the demand. This problem might be especially prevalent in Major cities.\nDoes the Minecraft Earth team have any plans to help solve this potential issue?\nA: This is a really good question and we are working on a new exciting system to deal with this. Don't worry, if you want to show you build off to the world you will be able to. More news soon.",

Buildplates are table top so you'd have to tower over your build if you are building too high. Although, we are exploring some accessibility options to make building easier. But to answer your point, no you would not be able to move like vanilla minecraft\n\nQ: Will shaders be available or texture packs or anything of the sorts?\nA: Would be great if you can post this on the feedback website to see how many of you would like this feature\n\nQ: Do you plan to update the game as minecraft gets updates, say like the village and pillage update, are there plans to continue adding in all minecraft features in the future to mce?\nA: It may or may not be 1:1 with other updates, but we want to get you the full minecraft experience in your hands on your phone\n\nQ: Do you plan to have a friends list?\nA: Something of that sort, Yes \n\nQ: Will people from other areas say not near you be able to join your build plate and play with you, like say a sort of server situation? Or is this possibly planned?\nA:  Yes with Build with Friends you simply place your Buildplate on a surface and then invite your friend. They scan a code and boom they are immediately in your game. You do need to be in the same room though as you are building in the same space. Its awesome.\n\nQ: What would happen if you used all of your build plates, will there constantly be more as you level? And if so is there a level cap of any sorts? And say as you level will the leveling get harder and hard until it is say impossible?\nA: Higher levels would unlock more buildplates and there will definitely be additional ways to get them",

You will be able to get together with friends, explore and see what you can find.\n\n-Will players be able to choose their own names when starting in game? Or are we forced to use our xbox gamertags?\nA: All players use the Xbox Gamertags, but you can choose to display it or not.\n\n-Will the friends list show the player, a bio and say your favourite build plate or all of your build plates for them to view?\nA: Great ideas, we are currently working on a lot of interesting social ideas. Stay tuned.\n\n-Would you have seasonal biomes, say the biomes would switch per season in the game so everyone has access to all biomes close to them? Also it would be something to look forward to every quarter year!\nA: More good ideas. Biomes are very important to Minecraft  and something we may consider for future updates",

Any changes you make to it are saved. You can invite friends to your session to play them. No support for command blocks. \n\nQ: Could there ever be a possibility of porting a chunk of a world from any other Minecraft edition such as Java or Bedrock and putting it into Minecraft Earth to use on a build plate?\nA: The answer is no because you have to earn/collect resources in game. Being able to port a chunk would mean free resources",
